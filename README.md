# Parallex Website

A front-end website activity brought from Codehal

### Notes: 
* This is my first ever front-end project in which I'm also using Adobe Photoshop.
* Although I was successful in the overall activity, I don't yet have the sufficient expertise to completely personalize it. In a near future I would like to place better images and have unlimited information contained.
